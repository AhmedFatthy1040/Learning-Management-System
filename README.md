# Learning-Management-System
A Learning Management System (LMS) is an online system or software which is used to plan, execute, and assess a specific learning process.

## Features

- **Admin Management:** The admin has full control over the system. They can manage mentors by adding, deleting, and updating mentor profiles. They can also manage courses by adding new courses, deleting existing ones, and updating course information.

- **Mentor Functionality:** Mentors have the ability to contribute to the LMS by adding exams, questions, and course content. They can create exams with multiple-choice or open-ended questions, add course material such as lectures, assignments, and resources, and interact with students through the platform.

- **Student Interactions:** Students can register and log in to the LMS to access their enrolled courses. They can view course content provided by mentors, take exams assigned by mentors, and track their progress. The system also provides a platform for students to communicate with mentors and fellow students through discussion forums.

- **User Authentication:** The LMS incorporates a secure user authentication system that ensures only registered users can access the system. Students and mentors can create their accounts, log in securely, and maintain their profiles.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly learning management solution for educational institutions. Whether you are an administrator, mentor, or student, this LMS offers the necessary tools and features to streamline the learning process and enhance collaboration between all stakeholders.

## How to Install and Run the Project

To install your Learning Management System project, you will need to set up the Apache server (using XAMPP or a similar package), MySQL DBMS, and PHP. Here's a brief guide on how to install these components:

Apache Server (XAMPP):

Download XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Run the XAMPP installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Choose the components to install (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin).
Select the installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp) and complete the installation process.
MySQL DBMS:

During the XAMPP installation, MySQL will be automatically installed. No further steps are required for the basic setup.
If you prefer to install MySQL separately, you can download it from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
Follow the MySQL installation instructions for your operating system.
PHP:

XAMPP comes with PHP installed, so no additional installation steps are needed.
If you prefer to install PHP separately, you can download it from the official PHP website: https://www.php.net/downloads.php
Follow the PHP installation instructions for your operating system.
Once you have successfully installed XAMPP (which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP), you can proceed with setting up your Learning Management System project:

-  Clone or download your project's repository from GitHub.
-  Place the project files inside the appropriate directory (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs for XAMPP).
-  Launch XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
-  Open a web browser and visit http://localhost or http://localhost/your-project-folder to access your project.
-  Import the provided database schema using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command-line interface.
  
Once the setup is complete, you should be able to use and access your Learning Management System through the specified URL.
